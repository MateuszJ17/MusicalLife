<h3>Overview</h3>
<hr/>
<span>This is a student project created in ASP.NET Core. I'm using this opportunity to learn as much as I can. I'm aware that there is <b>A LOT</b> of sloppy code and solutions but keep in mind that this is my first project created in this technology. I already have learned so much while doing it so I hope to get better with web development using ASP soon.</span>
